    """Takes a list and generates all the unique pairs it contains.
    The order of the pairs is not important and the ordering of each pair is

    This function was written by gatoatigrado (Stack Overflow username) and the
    original can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13020502
    I have used this function as it precisely gives me what I wanted, without
    producing excessive repeated pairings for this application.
    Args:
        lst (list): a list of items to be paired up
    Yields:
        list: The next set of pairs. Each pair consists of items from the
              original list placed within a tuple.
    Example:
        Here is an example of the output for a list of 4 items.
        >>> for pairs in all_pairs([1, 2, 3, 4]):
                print pairs
        [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
        [(1, 3), (2, 4)]
        [(1, 4), (2, 3)]
        For a list of 4 items, the argument to the itertools.product() function
        is:
            [0, 1, 2], [0]
        Which will produce the following output from the product() function:
            (0, 0)
            (1, 0)
            (2, 0)
        So these results mean there will be 3 sets of pairs containing 2 pairs
        each.
        For the first set (0, 0), the pop function is always pop(0) - taking
        the first item off the temp list. So this just produces two pairs in the
        same order as per the original list.
        For set (1, 0), the first pair is (1, 3), as the first item of the first
        pair is always the first item from the original list and the 1 means an
        item is skipped and 3 is selected. The second pair is just what is left,
        (2, 4).
        For set (2, 0), 2 items are skipped, so the first pair is (1, 4). Then
        what's left is (2, 3) for the 2nd pair.
